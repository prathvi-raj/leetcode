 Given an unsorted array of integers nums, return the length of the longest consecutive elements sequence.

 You must write an algorithm that runs in O(n) time.



 Example 1:

 Input: nums = [100,4,200,1,3,2]
 Output: 4
 Explanation: The longest consecutive elements sequence is [1, 2, 3, 4]. Therefore its length is 4.
 Example 2:

 Input: nums = [0,3,7,2,5,8,4,6,0,1]
 Output: 9


 [0,3,7,2,5,8,4,6,0,1]

 [1,1,1,2,1,2,3,4,1,]

 Constraints:

 0 <= nums.length <= 105
 -109 <= nums[i] <= 109

class Solution {
    func longestConsecutive(_ nums: [Int]) -> Int {

    }
}
